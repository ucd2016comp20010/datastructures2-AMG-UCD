Q6:
What is the difference between a singly linked list and a circularly linked list?
    A singularly linked list has a defined end to the list, while a circularly linked list loops back from the tail to the head


Q7:
In what situations would you prefer to use a linked list to an array?
    A linked list is preferred when there is a need for a dynamic number of elements being used


Q8:
Describe 2 possible use-cases for a circularly linked list (2-3 sentences for each).
    -When you need to implement a cycling list of items that will eventually repeat on itself

    -Useful when you need to compare 2 lists and are doing it in an itterative method, allowing the second list to continuously cycle over and over without needing to reset the current pointer to the head manually
